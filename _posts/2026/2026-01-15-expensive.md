I've spent the past 15 years building open source software in my spare time, most of it in support of JSON in .Net.  That work has spanned 17 families of Nuget packages (42 unique packages total) with over 140 million total downloads, and all of it completely free.

Some time ago, more from a curiosity of the possible than anything else, I set up my GitHub Sponsors page. While hoping voluntary support might sustain the project, I've only acquired three (now two) sponsors, for whom I remain genuinely thankful.  It's clear now that a different approach is needed.

Moving forward, to ensure the long-term sustainability of this project, I will be introducing a monthly maintenance fee, required to be paid by all organizations or users of any library from this project who generate revenue. You can pay the fee via that same [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/gregsdennis) page I set up so long ago.

The maintenance fee will go into effect starting 1 Feb 2026. To enact this, an EULA on binary releases will be added to the repo and Nuget packages that requires payment of the maintenance fee.  I will be making these changes to the repo in the days leading up to this date.

For more information on who must pay the fee and other frequently asked questions, please see the [Open Source Maintenance Fee](https://opensourcemaintenancefee.org/consumers/) organisation page.

_If you aren't generating revenue, you like the work I put out, and you would still like to support the project, please consider [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/gregsdennis)!_
